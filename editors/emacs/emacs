; Note:
;
;  Most of the Emacs configuration was forked from Bozhidar Batsov emacs-prelude
;  (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Prelude). I had to change far too many
;  things to incorporate into the original work. The reality is, I don't know
;  Lisp nor Emacs Lisp well enough to work around Bozhidar's defaults. Many
;  thanks to him for showing me the way to a better Emacs experience.
